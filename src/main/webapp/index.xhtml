        <h3>About this JSF Web App With Security Demo</h3>
        <p>Web security is a complex topic but the basics come down to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Authentication:</b> when you log in your credentials are
                checked against a database for a match. If the match is found
                you are allowed to proceed (you are authenticated); if not, access
                is denied.</li>
            <li><b>Authorization:</b> Once you are authenticated you must
                be authorized to access certain content. For example a general
                user may not be authorized to access areas of a web site that 
                are designed for administrators only. Authorization is based on 
                the idea that user accounts belong to one or more groups or 
                roles. This membership results in authorization to view certain
                parts of a web site.</li>
            <li><b>Encryption:</b> As data moves from client to server and
                back again, the data can be intercepted by a "sniffer" program -- 
                a tool hackers use to steal passwords, credit card info and more.
                Without encryption, which is not turned on by default, a web site
                is vulnerable to this type of hacking because the data is flowing
                as plain text. Encrypting this data flow is one way to thwart the
                hackers' attempts at interception. A common tool for encryption is
                SSL (Secure Socket Layer). We won't go into details here (you can
                and should research this on your own) except to say that the steps
                necessary for configuring security on your server will enable SSL.</li>
            <li><b>Encryption in the Database:</b> It's not just the data
                flowing from client to server that is at risk. Passwords and other 
                sensitive data stored in databases are also at risk. Imagine, e.g.,
                a disgruntled employee with server administration rights. This 
                person could easily steal the sensitive data if it is not also
                stored in encrypted form. We'll be using a "hashing" algorithm 
                called "SHA-256" for this.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Let's Start the Demo. Select where you want to go:</h3>
        <p>Note that in the address bar of your web browser the protocol will
            change from "http:" to "https:" indicating that the data flow is 
            being encrypted by SSL.</p>
        <p><h:link outcome="admin/index" value="To the admin section" /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Username, password: bob, password1</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h:link outcome="users/index" value="To the user section" /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Username, password: sally, password2</li>
            <li>Username, password: tom, password3</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Logging Out of the Application</h3>
        <p>A well designed web app must provide a convenient way for users to
            log out, so that their account can not be used by someone else
            with access to their computer.</p>
        <h:form>
            <h:commandLink action="#{logoutBean.logout}" value="Logout" />
        </h:form>
    </h:body>
