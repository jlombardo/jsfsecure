        <!--
            The significant thing to understand about this form is that it
            uses a mixture of regular HTML tags and JSF tags. Let's start
            by discussing the HTML form tag. Notice it has an action attribute
            that points to "j_security_check". This is a built-in servlet that
            is part of every Java Web Application server, but never seen. It
            handles authentication and authorization. Next notice that all 
            input is handled by regular HTML input tags ... not by JSF input tags.
            The reason for this is that we are not sending data to a JSF
            Managed Bean, but rather to the servlet discussed above. Finally,
            notice that even the submit button is a plain HTML input tag
            instead of a JSF commandButton. Again, this is because we are
            submitting the form to the servlet, not to a JSF bean. And the
            names of the input tags must be exactly as indicated. No custom
            names allowed! Also, please not that these comments would normally
            cause a JSF page to not display correctly. See the web.xml which
            has an entry that allows this.
